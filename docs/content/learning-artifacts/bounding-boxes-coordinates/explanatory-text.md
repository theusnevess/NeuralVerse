# Corner, Center, and Normalized Coordinates

## Artifact Summary

This artifact belongs to the Bounding Boxes and Coordinate Systems topic and serves as a Explanatory Text.

## Required Contract Fields

### objective

Explain xyxy and xywh formats and relative normalized formats.

### explanation

Bounding boxes define the spatial extent of objects in an image. The two most common formats are: 1. $[x_{min}, y_{min}, x_{max}, y_{max}]$ ($xyxy$ format), representing the top-left and bottom-right corners. 2. $[x_{center}, y_{center}, w, h]$ ($xywh$ format), representing the box center coordinates, width, and height. To make these box parameters scale-independent across different image sizes, object detectors normalize coordinate values by dividing them by the image width and height, keeping all outputs in the relative range $[0.0, 1.0]$.

## Optional Enrichment Fields

### motivation

Understanding this topic is critical for building autonomous vehicles, industrial inspections, robotic manipulators, and multi-object real-time surveillance backbones.

## Dependency Notes

This artifact is part of the Bounding Boxes and Coordinate Systems content pack.

## Reuse Notes

No reuse mode is asserted. The artifact can participate independently in different instructional contexts.

## Accessibility Notes

Text descriptions are provided for all conceptual spaces.

## Evidence Boundary

This Learning Artifact supports learning.

It does not generate Competency Evidence.
