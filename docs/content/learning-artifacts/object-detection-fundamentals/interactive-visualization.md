# Feature Map Header Split Spec

## Artifact Summary

This artifact belongs to the Object Detection Fundamentals topic and serves as a Interactive Visualization.

## Required Contract Fields

### objective

Specify a dynamic task splitter showing regression and classification channels.

### explanation

This specification describes a detection head task-splitting layout. The user drags a slider showing an image passing through a CNN backbone, splitting into a localization regression vector (x, y, w, h) and a class probability classification vector.

## Optional Enrichment Fields

### motivation

Understanding this topic is critical for building autonomous vehicles, industrial inspections, robotic manipulators, and multi-object real-time surveillance backbones.

## Dependency Notes

This artifact is part of the Object Detection Fundamentals content pack.

## Reuse Notes

No reuse mode is asserted. The artifact can participate independently in different instructional contexts.

## Accessibility Notes

Text descriptions are provided for all conceptual spaces.

## Evidence Boundary

This Learning Artifact supports learning.

It does not generate Competency Evidence.

It does not certify mastery.

If this artifact is used in an assessment context, that usage must be governed separately by NV-800-M4 and NV-800-M3.
