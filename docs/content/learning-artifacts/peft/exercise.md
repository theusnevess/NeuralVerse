# LoRA Parameter Calculation

## Artifact Summary

Provides practice applying the concepts of LoRA Parameter Calculation — guides the learner through reasoning steps that reinforce understanding of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) through active problem-solving.

## Required Contract Fields

### objective

Calculate parameter savings from low-rank constraints.

### learner task

Given a weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{4096 \times 4096}$ and a LoRA rank $r = 8$. Calculate: 1. The number of parameters in the original matrix. 2. The number of trainable parameters in LoRA matrices $A$ and $B$ combined.

### expected learner output

The learner should reason through the problem step by step, showing their work for each part. The expected output illustrates the reasoning format but not the complete solution.

This practice does not assign a score and does not certify mastery.

## Optional Enrichment Fields

### motivation

Adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks is a core practice in modern ML — these techniques enable efficient specialization without full retraining.

## Dependency Notes

This artifact is part of the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) content pack.

## Reuse Notes

No reuse mode is asserted. The artifact can participate independently in different instructional contexts.

## Accessibility Notes

Text descriptions are provided for all conceptual spaces.

## Evidence Boundary

This Learning Artifact supports learning.

It does not generate Competency Evidence.

It does not certify mastery.

If this artifact is used in an assessment context, that usage must be governed separately by NV-800-M4 and NV-800-M3.
