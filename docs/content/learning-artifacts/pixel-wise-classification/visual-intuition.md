# Massive Classifier Grid

## Artifact Summary

This artifact belongs to the Pixel-wise Classification topic and serves as a Visual Intuition.

## Required Contract Fields

### objective

Provide an analogy based on running independent classification cells.

### explanation

Imagine an image as a massive grid of tiny boxes (pixels). Instead of asking a neural network to look at the whole grid and guess one label, we ask the network to look at each individual box and classify it independently. It is like running a mini-classifier a million times, once for every single pixel in the image.

## Optional Enrichment Fields

### motivation

Understanding segmentation is critical for building medical scanners, self-driving cars, satellite crop trackers, and human-in-the-loop image editors.

## Dependency Notes

This artifact is part of the Pixel-wise Classification content pack.

## Reuse Notes

No reuse mode is asserted. The artifact can participate independently in different instructional contexts.

## Accessibility Notes

Text descriptions are provided for all conceptual spaces.

## Evidence Boundary

This Learning Artifact supports learning.

It does not generate Competency Evidence.

It does not certify mastery.

If this artifact is used in an assessment context, that usage must be governed separately by NV-800-M4 and NV-800-M3.
